# Claude Code Everywhere Project 
This is a Claude Code Project can be used everywhere.

## Rules

1. **Keep the codebase clean and minimal.**  
   Avoid unnecessary files and ensure the repository stays tidy and easy to maintain.

2. **Always refine before pushing code.**  
   Before every push, run **code-simplifier** to simplify and refine the code.

3. **Make sure tests are passed。**
   Run tests in under tests/ to make the functions work fine.
